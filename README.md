# Original ElevenFifty Portfolio
EFA Project - Original HTML/CSS portfolio made in EFA web dev course.

This is the original portfolio we began developing in the web development bootcamp course at ElevenFifty. At the time we were really just starting to learn JavaScript and dipping our toes into some foundational projects and tutorials, but we soon started working a lot more with JS and learning React. After graduation, I decided to start redoing my portfolio with React and the Material UI library, but I want to keep this one around to show my progress as my skills improve.

This portfolio is written entirely in HTML and CSS, so it is a static page. My new portfolio is made with React, using Material UI styling, and is designed to be responsive.
